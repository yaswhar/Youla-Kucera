# Youla-Kucera
A MATLAB function I developed for the Fundamentals of Automatic Control Design Course. This function automatically solves the Bezout Equation and Youla-Kucera Theorem for IMC.

Main function is called `youlaKucera` and `script_yk` is a script demonstrating how it works with examples.
